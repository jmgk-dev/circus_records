        <div class="artist-name">FLUX PAVILION</div>
        <div>A true polymath, Flux Pavilionâ€™s ability to involve himself in all aspects of music cannot be understated. Known as Joshua Steele to friends and family, he is a singer-songwriter, record producer and label owner who can express himself as well with the drums, guitar, saxophone and piano as well as he can behind the studio desk. Releasing his first record at only 19 years old, over the course of a decade at the top of the bass music game Joshua has sold out the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado twice, notched up a UK top 10 chart hit with grime MC Sway, earned a place in the hallowed DJ Mag top 100 list and had the legendary Kanye West & Jay Z sample his dance floor anthem I Cant Stop.</div>
